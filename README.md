# Rabbits

A small side project to calculate population growth of rabbits.

## TODO & Notes:

- We need to figure out a few variables and research their average statistical data.

  - _Maturation Period_ = The time elapsed from when a rabbit is born, to when it is sexually mature.
  - _Gestation Period_ = The time elapsed from when a female rabbit is impregnated, to when it gives birth.
  - _Recovery Period_ = The time elapsed from when a female rabbit gives birth, to when it can be impregnated again.
  - _Litter Size_ = The number of baby rabbits born to a single female, per birth.
  - _Gender Ratio_ = The ratio of male to female rabbbits in a population.
    - (While this is close to 50%, any discrepancy will result in faster or slower population growth).
  - _Life Expectancy_ = The time elapsed from when a female rabbit is born, to when it dies from natural causes.
    - These causes range from old age, to environmental factors such as predators, food availability, disease, etc.

#### Research:

- Gestation period of many common types of rabbits:

  - Eastern cottontail: 27 days
  - European rabbit: 28-35 days
  - Swamp rabbit: 37 days
  - Desert cottontail: 28 days
  - Common Tapeti: 42-45 days
  - New England Cottontail: 28 days
  - Brush Rabbit: 27 days
  - Mexican Cottontail: 30 days
  - Dice's Cottontail: 30 days

- We will use the European Cottontail as it is one of the most common rabbits with plenty of study data.
